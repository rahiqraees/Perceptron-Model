# Perceptron Model from Scratch

This project implements a **Perceptron model** in Python from first principles. The Perceptron is one of the earliest neural network models and serves as the foundation for modern machine learning. It is a linear classifier that updates weights based on misclassified examples until convergence.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Implemented the **Perceptron learning algorithm** from scratch  
- Explored how linear decision boundaries separate binary classes  
- Visualized convergence behavior through weight updates  
- Compared performance across different datasets and learning rates  
- Documented algorithm details inside the notebook for clarity  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **From Scratch Implementation**: Perceptron algorithm coded without ML libraries  
- **Decision Boundaries**: Visualization of class separation  
- **Learning Behavior**: Showed convergence when data is linearly separable  
- **Experiments**: Effect of different learning rates and dataset structures  

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib
